# Synthetic Programming Language

## Overview

Synthetic is a simple, C-style programming language currently in development. It's an interpreted language that plans to transition into a compiled language. This project is an educational endeavour aimed at improving coding and development skills.

## Learning Focus

The development of Synthetic is a practical learning exercise. It's a hands-on project that provides insight into language design, interpretation, and compilation. This project is ideal for those looking to deepen their understanding of programming languages.

## Resources

For guidance in developing Synthetic, the following resources are being used:

- "Writing An Interpreter in Go" by Thorsten Ball
- "Writing A Compiler in Go" by Thorsten Ball
- Educational content from [CodeDifferent](https://www.youtube.com/@codedifferent)

These resources are instrumental in offering both foundational knowledge and advanced concepts in language development.

## Contributions

Contributions to Synthetic are welcomed. This project is an opportunity for both experienced developers and beginners to learn, collaborate, and contribute to the development of a new programming language.
